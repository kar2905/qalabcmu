Hyposmia is a reduced ability to smell and to detect odours. A related condition is anosmia, in which no odours can be detected. Some of the causes of olfaction problems are allergies, nasal polyps, viral infections and head trauma. It is estimated that up to 4 million people in the United States have hyposmia or the related anosmia.

Based on latest scientific evidence, hyposmia might be a very early sign of Parkinson's disease.[1] Hyposmia is also an early and almost universal finding in Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.[1]
